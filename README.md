# WOLF-LIVE

# setup
You will need to install the following on the system:
  - node.js
  - python (3.x.x)
You must install atleast one of them, so if your using node.js server then install node.js, and leave python.

# begin
You will need to have your node.js OR main.py file ready to go, since it only hosts the file, not create it.
After that, you can open the "wolf-live-setup.exe" file, which will setup the app. After when it opens, you can click the "+ Launch" button, and then you can select your file (node.js or python). This will launch the file for you so you and will start the server with the link/URL shown above the terminal. 

# Why is this good?
This app can start a server for you without you needing to install libraries. This is major as if your not a tech genius, you will want to have the lowest effort. And its also more easier and doesnt take as much work!
